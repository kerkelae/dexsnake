Dexsnake
========

Dexsnake is a lightweight Python package that makes it easy to make trades on
decentralized exchanges (DEXs) like `Uniswap <https://uniswap.org/>`_. The package is
designed for Python developers, quants, data scientists, algorithmic traders, and others
who are used to working in Python but may not have in-depth knowledge about blockchains
and decentralized apps. The code is organized to closely follow the structure of the
smart contracts, ensuring that by using Dexsnake, users also gain an understanding of
the underlying protocols.
